# Twilight Operator
## Extending Twilight with some sweet italic love.

I've always loved the muted simplicity of Twilight.  It's easy on the eyes, easy to read, and has an almost retro look with the olive strings and toned down pastels.

Currently the italicsification is fairly python specific however it will be expanded upon over time.
